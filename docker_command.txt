## To start learning docker first install docker asp per your host OS . You can get detail of how to install docker in respective OS.
After that make an account in docker hub and then start using below command

# COmmand to login in docker from your system to download image is 
docker login
# after tyoing this command it will ask for cred, type that and you will login docker hub using cli

# before starting any docker container we need images to boot. It is as same before  doing anything in computer we need an OS image. To download any image we can use below command

docker pull <image name> 
Ex - docker pull centos
     docker pull redis

# After pulling any command we need to start the container, same as after getting os image in pendrive or cd we need to boot it and start installing

docker run < image name>
Ex - docker run centos
     docker run redis

# To check if container is running is we can use below command.
docker ps

#Now there is twist, if you have executed the same command has i had mentioned, then when you excute command to check container status you will only see one container i,e redis, as container live for that time only as the process inside container is running, so when docker run centos is executed it will only start centos os , but there is no process inside os it it start and stop. TO check that you can use

docker ps -a 

# this command will show you all container how has started and exited or stopped.

# to stop a container
docker stop < container id/ name (which you can get from docker ps command) >
 
 # To remove container

 docker rm  < container id/ name (which you can get from docker ps command) >
 
 # to list all docker image in your system
 docker image ls

 #to delete image
 docker rmi < image name >

 # to check log of container
 docker log < container id/ name (which you can get from docker ps command) >
 
 #to run conatiner in dettach mode, by default it run in foreground
 docker run -d < image name >

 #As we run container , we run with an default application like webserver or db, so we need to access that server on specfic port, to access the service from os  server we use port paramter to tell docker that application should be accessable from the os port and should be mapped with docker mentioned port

 docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis

 # When we run any docker conatiner the docker assign a name by deafult to it if we haven't mentioned, we check that name using docker ps command.t To set a self assigned name, we can use below command

 docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -name redis1 redis

 # So now we have a little bit of knowledge of docker command, so we will move forward. Now suppose we hae to run mysql container, so we are aware that when we install mysql, we need to set the root password for mysql, so we hae to pass the variable with run to set password, so how we can do it , we will find that from docker hub. Go to docker hub website and search for mysql image. Click on image and it will show you some basic info about mysql container. There you can find , how we can pass the mysql password during initialing container.

 docker run --name mysql1 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-password -d mysql
 
 #So here we see that we have given mysql password in run command, so now you are thing what -e means, so let me explain we have set the env variable using -e. I will explain you my giving example. As in linux we have to set any env variable we use export command to set enviroment variable.The same work is done by -e parameter. As per mysql image it pick value from MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD variable value to set password for mysql container.

 #So now suppose it need to install some specfic version of mysql or any other image, we can alsi do that
 
 docker run --name mysql1 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-password -d mysql:5.6

# it will start container with mysql 5.6 version
